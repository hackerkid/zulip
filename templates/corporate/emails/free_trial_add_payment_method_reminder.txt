Just want to give a heads up that your free trial of Zulip Standard plan for {{ realm_string_id }} will be ending in
{{ days_remaining }} days.

If you want to continue on Zulip Standard after the free trial, make sure to add a payment_method in your
Zulip organization billing page by going to
{{ billing_url }}.

If you don't add a payment method before the free trial ends, you won't be charged and your organization will be downgraded
to our Zulip free plan with limited message history, reduced storage space etc.

Please look at the plans page for more details.
